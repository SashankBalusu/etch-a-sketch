# etch-a-sketch

This etch a sketch allows you to create a grid to the size of your choosing, then draw in it with either a black pen or a rainbow pen. You can also use an eraser
to make the grid go back to its original state as well as simply reset the grid.

Known bug:
If you click change size, you are only able to change the size the second time you enter a number, the first time you enter a number, nothing happens and it prompts
you to reenter a grid size.
